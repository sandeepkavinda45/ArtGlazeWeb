                <h1>About Pottery</h1>
                <p>Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard and durable form. Major types include earthenware, stoneware and
                    porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural "potteries"). The definition of pottery, used by the ASTM International, is "all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except
                    technical, structural, and refractory products." In art history and archaeology, especially of ancient and prehistoric periods, "pottery" often means vessels only, and sculpted figurines of the same material are called "terracottas".
                    Clay as a part of the materials used is required by some definitions of pottery, but this is dubious</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>A great part of the history of pottery is prehistoric, part of past pre-literate cultures. Therefore, much of this history can only be found among the artifacts of archaeology. Because pottery is so durable, pottery and shards of pottery
                    survive from millennia at archaeological sites, and are typically the most common and important type of artifact to survive. Many prehistoric cultures are named after the pottery that is the easiest way to identify their sites, and
                    archaeologists develop the ability to recognise different types from the chemistry of small shards.</p>

                <h1>Archaeology</h1>
                <p>The study of pottery can help to provide an insight into past cultures. Fabric analysis (see section below), used to analyse the fabric of pottery, is important part of archaeology for understanding the archaeological culture of the excavated
                    site by studying the fabric of artifacts, such as their usage, source material composition, decorative pattern, color of patterns, etc. This helps to understand characteristics, sophistication, habits, technology, tools, trade, etc.
                    of the people who made and used the pottery. Carbon dating reveals the age. Sites with similar pottery characteristics have the same culture, those sites which have distinct cultural characteristics but with some overlap are indicative
                    of cultural exchange such as trade or living in vicinity or continuity of habitation, etc. Examples are black and red ware, redware, Sothi-Siswal culture and Painted Grey Ware culture. The six fabrics of Kalibangan is a good example
                    of use of fabric analysis in identifying a differentiated culture which was earlier thought to be typical Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) culture.</p>

                <h1>Source material</h1>
                <p>The "clay body" is also called the "paste" or the "fabric", which consists of 2 things, the "clay matrix" composed of grains of less than 0.02 mm grains which can be seen using the high-powered microscopes or a Scanning Electron Microscope
                    (SEM), and the "clay inclusions" which are larger grains of clay and could be seen with the naked eye or a low-power binocular microscope. For geologists, fabric analysis means spatial arrangement of minerals in a rock. For Archaeologists,
                    the "fabric analysis" of pottery entails the study of clay matrix and inclusions in the clay body as well as the firing temperature and conditions. Analysis is done to examine the following 3 in detail:</p>

                <h1>Production issues</h1>
                <p>Although many of the environmental effects of pottery production have existed for millennia, some of these have been amplified with modern technology and scales of production. The principal factors for consideration fall into two categories:
                    effects on workers, and effects on the general environment. The chief risks on worker health include heavy metal poisoning, poor indoor air quality, dangerous sound levels and possible over-illumination.</p>
